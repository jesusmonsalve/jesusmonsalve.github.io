				<p class="subhead"> Branding & Motion Designer<p>
			 <article>
				<p>I am a designer that comes from the beautiful country of Venezuela. Since I was young I had an avid eye for details and sense of style. When it was time to choose my academic future I knew I wanted to design and create things.</p>
				<p>I would consider myself wondrous, curious, romantic and mostly passionate about the goals I set in life.</p>
				<p> I am currently a third year student in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. I love making logo designs and having fun creating interesting motion graphic work.</p>
